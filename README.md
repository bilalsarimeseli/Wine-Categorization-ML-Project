# Wine-Categorization-ML-Project
Italian wine dataset with outcomes of a chemical analysis for three cultivars in a specific region. It includes measurements for 13 components, and aims to use k-Means Clustering to create a machine learning model categorizing wine samples based on similar malic acid and alcohol content.

For this project, I have a dataframe consisting of various chemical analyses of wines grown in the same region in Italy and from three different cultivars. Below are a list of constituents for which data was collected—amongst others—for your reference:

**alcohol**: the alcohol content of a wine sample
**malic acid**: the malic acid content of a wine sample
**hue**: the hue index of a sample of wine
**od280/od315_of_diluted_wines**: a method of quantitatively assessing the protein content of a sample of wine

# Key Questions:

# Using k-Means Clustering:
Grouping the wine samples by similar malic acid and alcohol contents.
- What is the optimal k-Means parameter? How many groups are there?
# Using k-Means Clustering:
Grouping the wine samples by similar proline and OD280 contents.
- What is the optimal k-Means parameter? How many groups are there?
Goals

Employ pairplots to visually analyze the data and identify potential variables suitable for clustering.
Develop and assess a k-Means Clustering model to categorize wine samples based on comparable malic acid and alcohol content.
Execute and evaluate a k-Means Clustering model to categorize wine samples based on similar proline and OD280 content.
